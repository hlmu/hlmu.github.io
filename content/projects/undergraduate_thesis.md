description: >-
    <li>Improved the <strong>contextual spoken language understanding system</strong> by using <strong>Heterogeneous Attention Networks (HAN)</strong> to jointly model the semantic information and domain transitions of dialogue, and disambiguate semantic frame parsing by explicitly modeling domain transition phenomena.</li>
    <li>Experiments on the SGD dataset showed that the proposed method achieved SOTA results, leading previous best models by 2.18% in semantic frame accuracy and 1.1% in intent accuracy.</li>
    <li>Explored the performance of pre-trained models in the system, achieving an improvement of 1.02% in semantic frame accuracy on top of the proposed model.</li>
    <li>Supervised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/qinlibo/zh_CN/index.htm">Libo Qin</a>.</li>
